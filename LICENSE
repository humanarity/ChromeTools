This software's copyright is retained by Humanarity.

You're not free to do just anything you want with it, but really,
how are we going to stop you? 

I mean, we put this software up here in the first place, so we're 
practically responsible for it being available for you to use, even 
if we're not responsible for what you choose to do with it.

So even if we wanted you to do something particular with it, and not
do something else with it, you'll likely just do what you want anyway, 
and there's not really anyway for us to stop you doing that. 

This doesn't mean we won't ever try to stop you, and it doesn't mean 
we condone, support or care about how you use it. It also doesn't mean
we do not condone, do not support or do not care how you use it. Whether
or not we do those things will depend on what we choose, which will be 
contributed to, in all likelihood, by how it is you choose to use it.

This license file is insufficient to enumerate all possible present and 
future policies we may create and reactions we may have to things you choose
to do with it, and really, how could any file do that?

The idea that a license file can account for and somehow circumscribe all 
eventualities is invalid. 

So one point of this license file is to demonstrate the insufficiency of license
files to achieve their intended purpose, controlling the use of something.

This does not mean, that we do or do not, support or not support the idea of
controlling something, it means that it would appear that license files are
unsuitable for such a purpose. 

Which is one contributing reason we have chosen to elaborate on their 
insufficiency in this license file. A license file attempting to scare
or intimidate people into doing or not doing something is just stupid. 

It's a file, it's not scary or intimidating. And it has no effective power, so
including a request is just a demonstration of weakness. Accompanying the 
request by legal threats at the very outset is not very friendly. 

Ideally, a license file is like a first date, you make an impression, you get
to know someone and you perhaps develop an idea of whether you will work 
together or not. 

A lot of that is based on honesty, so we're being honest. 

Humanarity is a company, our aim is to make money and pursue our aims, whatever
we choose those aims to be. Your aims and our aims may or may not align, at
different points in time. 

In all likelihood, because of statistics, what you choose to do with this will 
be completely inconsequential to us. And yet, also because of statistics, there
may be occassions where it is not inconsequential. 

If you choose to use this software, you're liable for what happens as a 
result of that, not Humanarity. 

If you choose to use it for something illegal, or use it to 
attempt to harm people or interests, then you are liable for that, 
not Humanarity. 

And if you do something with it, and if we choose that we do not want you doing that with it, 
and if we choose that we will try to stop you doing that with it, we are not going to come to you 
and say, "Do not do this, because it says not to in the license file", we are going to, in 
all likelihood, come to you and say, "Do not do this, because it is wrong."

And it doesn't work if you require a license file to know what is right and wrong.

So we're choosing to not say that such and such a use is prohibited, nor say that such and such
as use is condoned, and some reasons contributing to that choice are that saying that is 
not effective as you can and likely will choose to do just what you want anyway, 
prohibiting uses is not efficient as some things prohibited may turn out to be useful, 
a license file is insufficient to enumerate all possible eventualities so why falsely 
suggest the illusion of completeness by enumerating even some of these as thsi will likely 
just lead to counter productive confusion such as "You didn't say THAT wasn't allowed, 
but you did say THIS wasn't, so I thought, I can do THAT", which wastes everyone's time.

So these things don't work and Humanarity is a company that makes things that work, 
even license files.

So perhaps a way of summarising this stance is to say that, given no information to the contrary, 
we trust you. We trust you to use your own judgement to use this in ways that work for you. 

And whatever you do choose to do with it, is your responsibility, not ours. We trust that you will 
choose to do what's right, and what contributes positively to the world, and yet we know that it's possible
that you may not choose that, or that, through some paroxysm of chance, things may all go to pot anyway.

So, welcome to this our software repository on GitHub, and may the things you do work for you.
